# Earthy Blog (React + Vite)

This project is a **simple personal blog setup** built with React and Vite.
The goal is not scale, performance benchmarks, or feature density — just a clean place to write and publish pages with a **natural, earthy, editorial feel**.

## Purpose

- Create simple blog pages
- Focus on readability and typography
- Keep the layout calm, intentional, and uncluttered

## Stack

- **React + Vite** — fast, minimal setup
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **Radix UI / shadcn-style components** — used sparingly
- **Playfair Display & Lato** — editorial typography
- **React Router** — basic page navigation

## Design Philosophy

- Editorial over application-like
- Whitespace over borders
- Typography first
- Subtle interactions only
- Neutral, earthy color palette (stone, clay, moss tones)

## What This Is _Not_

- A CMS
- A component showcase
- A complex state-driven app

## Usage

This repo is meant to be:

- Modified freely
- Refactored without ceremony
- Used as a personal writing space

No guarantees. No roadmap. Just a place to write.

**Want it more minimal, more poetic, or more technical?**
I can tune the tone in either direction or add a tiny “writing workflow” section if that’d help future-you.
